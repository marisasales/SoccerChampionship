## SoccerChampionship
Santander Coders proposed this project, which involves creating a program that processes information from a CSV file, which contains the games of a soccer championship.

### Description
The code reads a CSV file containing matches from a soccer championship. The original file contains the following columns: home team, away team, goals scored by each team, and game time.
